  This function multiplies the 64-bit unsigned value Multiplicand by the 64-bit
  unsigned value Multiplier and generates a 64-bit unsigned result. This 64-
  bit unsigned result is returned.

  @param  Multiplicand  A 64-bit unsigned value.
  @param  Multiplier    A 64-bit unsigned value.

  @return Multiplicand * Multiplier
