  Shifts a 64-bit integer left between 0 and 63 bits. The low bits
  are filled with zeros. The shifted value is returned.

  This function shifts the 64-bit value Operand to the left by Count bits. The
  low Count bits are set to zero. The shifted value is returned.

  @param  Operand The 64-bit operand to shift left.
  @param  Count   The number of bits to shift left.
