/**
  Rotates a 64-bit integer right between 0 and 63 bits, filling
  the high bits with the high low bits that were rotated.

  This function rotates the 64-bit value Operand to the right by Count bits.
  The high Count bits are fill with the low Count bits of Operand. The rotated
  value is returned.

  @param  Operand The 64-bit operand to rotate right.
  @param  Count   The number of bits to rotate right.

  @return Operand >>> Count
