  Returns a 64-bit Machine Specific Register(MSR).

  Reads and returns the 64-bit MSR specified by Index. No parameter checking is
  performed on Index, and some Index values may cause CPU exceptions. The
  caller must either guarantee that Index is valid, or the caller must set up
  exception handlers to catch the exceptions. This function is only available
  on IA-32 and x64.

  @param  Index The 32-bit MSR index to read.

  @return The value of the MSR identified by Index.
