/**
  Divides a 64-bit signed integer by a 64-bit signed integer and generates a
  64-bit signed result and a optional 64-bit signed remainder.

  This function divides the 64-bit signed value Dividend by the 64-bit signed
  value Divisor and generates a 64-bit signed quotient. If Remainder is not
  NULL, then the 64-bit signed remainder is returned in Remainder. This
  function returns the 64-bit signed quotient.

  It is the caller's responsibility to not call this function with a Divisor of 0.
  If Divisor is 0, then the quotient and remainder should be assumed to be 
  the largest negative integer.

  If Divisor is 0, then ASSERT().

  @param  Dividend  A 64-bit signed value.
  @param  Divisor   A 64-bit signed value.
  @param  Remainder A pointer to a 64-bit signed value. This parameter is
                    optional and may be NULL.

  @return Dividend / Divisor
