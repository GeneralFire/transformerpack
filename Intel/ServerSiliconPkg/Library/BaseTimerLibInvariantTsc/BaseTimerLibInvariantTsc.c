  The Timer Library implementation which uses the Time Stamp Counter in the processor.
  Base Timer Library which uses the Time Stamp Counter in the processor.
  A version of the Timer Library using the processor's TSC.
  TSC reads are much more efficient and do not incur the overhead associated with a ring transition or
  access to a platform resource.
